# Arrays
## Keywords
- Data **`Type`**
  - A data `type` is a `class` of object that has a *predefined* set of methods and/or `properties`
  - Different data `types` include:
    - `String` - Most any text enlcosed in quotes `''`, double quotes `""`, or backticks ` `` `
    - `Number` - The physical symbol of a number: `0`, `1`, `2`
      - A `number` that is in string format `"0"`, is a `string` and ***not*** a `number`
    - `Boolean` - A value of `true` or `false` that is *not* a string: ~~`"true"`~~ ~~`"false"`~~
    - `Array` - a single-column table of data
  - If you find yourself with a variable whose data `type` is unknown to you, you can use the `typeOf()` function to find out.
    - `typeOf( new Array ) === "Array"` <= this line create a new Array object, gets the `type` of the object, and checks to see if the value is `"Array"`
